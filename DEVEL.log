* v0.3.0: new strategy: text verbatim, integrating to emacs
  - why broken: need further integration with emacs to specify cursor pos
  - freq of issue: every if-else and other paired construct in shell script
  - tried but failed to integrate external snippet system to expand embeded emacs-lisp code: failed -> develop one myself.
** files affected:
*** ~/sn/sn.sh [1/1]:
    now only serve as searching and printing out a template name + the shell-based parent-to-child-file-type transformation string (delimitted by '//' symbol)
    lost nesting capability -> made up for by emacs expand function embedded inside the snippet and expanded by some emacs-lisp code
    
    + [X] employing caching mechanism:
    
*** ~/sn/<the old snippet files> [1/2]:
    - [ ] convert snippet content into new syntax
      
*** ~/.emacs-autoloads/h-xpsnip.el [2/2]:
    - [X] use yas-expand-snippet
    - other: 
      + renamed from nch-insert-template.el for short
      
* v0.0.1: core features
  - code simplicity
  - conservative memory-usage: snippet content read only when needed - no auto-loading contents of ALL mode-specific snippets into memory - just 
  - nesting: snippet code call an sn function to expand another snippet inside it) 

  some snippet coding systems I am aware of:
  - too finely atomized codes -> complex code structure to maintain/improve on
  - dependencies on python ...
  - no parents' transformation
